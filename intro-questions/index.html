        <h1> Introductory Questions </h1>
        <ol>
            <li> Emma Hinckley, Marketing & Communication Design, Senior</li>
            <li> I am taking the class because it was a requirement for my second major in Com Des.</li>
            <li> I took Intro to Computer Science, so I have basic knowledge in JavaScript.</li>
            <li> I hope to learn the basics of html so when I am designing websites so that I have a better idea of what is happening behind the scenes.</li>
            <li> I think visibility and functionality will be much bigger aspects to keep in mind when designing on screen. On paper, you aren't thinking as much on the functionaity of how people will interact with the artwork.</li>
            <li> https://www.lacoste.com/us/lacoste-heritage.html#rene-lacoste The Lacoste heritage page on their website is incredibly compelling to look at visually. The way that they integrated movement with both the logo as you scroll plus moving images, provides interest to the viewer and keeps you compelled to continue to read the history of the company. The varied sizes of the images and layering of images on the page also implements design principles to the website. The buttons and links as you scroll allow you to easily learn more about parts of the site. </li>
            <li> https://www.flyhyer.com/ This website exemplifies effective communication through a minimalistic style. The site organizes the different componenets of their brand well, which allows the viewer to immediately understand what the company sells. One section shows their mission statement, then their solutions, and then popular destinations, and so on. The minimal type and large button at the bottom invites the viewer to book a flight. There is no guessing of where to go on the page, and takes the viewer on a journey through the website. </li>
            <li> https://spotify.design/ The wesbite for spotify design works well in my opinion because it implements both movement and clear communication. The carousel at the top of the page is visually pleasing and prompts the viewer to learn more about what the website offers. Then, the website has a new releases section that shows behind the scenes or Q&As. The part of the website that I think works the best is the spotlights on Spotify designers. The varying sizes of photos and interactive element of the flower appearing while you hover is really compelling and makes me want to learn more. </li>
