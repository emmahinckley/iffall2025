        <section class="lyrics">
            <p>Ooh, silence is making me nostalgic<br>
            Two sizes big you shared in my apartment<br>
            Oh, we were kids, but that don't make this less hard<br>
            If I could fly I doubt I'd even do it<br>
            I'd probably get high and crash or something stupid<br>
            You made Ohio feel just like Central Park</p>

            <p>Liberal red necks get drunk on a dirt road<br>
            Attention deficit kids in their gym clothes<br>
            Paper bags drift wherever the wind blows<br>
            And mine's full of receipts</p>

            <p>Ooh, this town is for the record now<br>
            The intersection got a Target<br>
            And they're calling it downtown<br>
            You and all of your new perspective now<br>
            Wish I could shut it in a closet<br>
            And drag you back down</p>

            <p>Gave me your word and now I can't pronounce it<br>
            No thing's so sure that I can't learn to doubt it<br>
            Now the state bird, it sings our song so out of key</p>

            <p>Liberal red necks get drunk on a dirt road<br>
            Attention deficit kids in their gym clothes<br>
            Paper bags drift wherever the wind blows<br>
            And mine's full of receipts</p>

            <p>Ooh, this town is for the record now<br>
            The intersection got a Target<br>
            And they're calling it downtown<br>
            You and all of your new perspective now<br>
            Wish I could shut it in a closet<br>
            And drag you back down<br>
            And drag you back down</p>

            And drag you back down<br>
            And drag you back down</p>
